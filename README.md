The eventual goal of this repo is to provide high quality, up-to-date, Docker images with multiple distros and architectures:

Target distros:
- Alpine stable
- Debian stable-slim
- Elementary stable
- Fedora latest
- Ubuntu latest (LTS)

Target architectures:
- `arm32v7`
- `arm64v8`
- `amd64`

Once these have been created, the next goal is to become Docker-official, so that users can do `docker run --rm -it vala:latest`.
